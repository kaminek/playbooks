# A bench of personal ansible playbooks

## Requirement

* Install `pipenv`.
* In case you need to add a new package( or package version) to the virtualenv,
update the `Pipfile` accordingly and don't forget to track the changes.

## TL;DR

* Install the virtualenv with the required packages using `pipenv install`
* Get to the virtualenv with `pipenv shell` (you can skip the first step).
